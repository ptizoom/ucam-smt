#### You can use this template to configure yourself
#### the ucam-smt package.
#### For example, maybe you already have the libraries installed
#### and you don't want to spend your valuable time waiting.
#### In that case, copy this file to Makefile.inc and
#### point each variable to the corresponding path 
#### for each library. Then run build-test.sh. 

### Please write in here the absolute path to HiFST:
export TOPDIR=</path/to/this/release>

### Modify these env variables to point to your boost/openfst installation
### or install them under externals.
export BOOST_INCLUDE=${TOPDIR}/externals/boost_1_53_0/INSTALL_DIR/include
export BOOST_LIB=${TOPDIR}/externals/boost_1_53_0/INSTALL_DIR/lib

export OPENFSTVERSION=1.3.2
export OPENFST_INCLUDE=${TOPDIR}/externals/openfst-1.3.2/INSTALL_DIR/include
export OPENFST_LIB=${TOPDIR}/externals/openfst-1.3.2/INSTALL_DIR/lib
export OPENFST_BIN=${TOPDIR}/externals/openfst-1.3.2/INSTALL_DIR/bin

## For google tests:
export GTEST_DIR=${TOPDIR}/externals/gtest-1.4.0;
export GTEST_INCLUDE=${TOPDIR}/externals/gtest-1.4.0/include
export GTEST_LIB=${TOPDIR}/externals/gtest-1.4.0/INSTALL_DIR/lib

# if defined, latmert can compile with these libraries  and will run much faster:
# export GPERFTOOLS_INCLUDE=${TOPDIR}/externals/gperftools-2.0/INSTALL_DIR/include
# export GPERFTOOLS_LIB=${TOPDIR}/externals/gperftools-2.0/INSTALL_DIR/lib
# export UNWIND_LIB=${TOPDIR}/externals/libunwind-1.0.1-install/lib

### Default KENLM package -- integrated with Hifst
export KENLM_DIR=${TOPDIR}/externals/kenlm/

### To integrate NPLM, uncomment these variables set them to the appropriate values:
#export NPLM_INCLUDE=...
#export NPLM_LIB=...
#export EIGEN_INCLUDE=...

### Number of cpus you want to use for compiling. 
### Each g++ instance can take 1.5G in memory.
export NUMPROC=1


#### Compilation type. Other options available, see build-test.sh
export TGTBINMK=O2
